---

## 🛡️ Security Improvements Implemented

### 1. **Content Security Policy (CSP)** 🔒
**What it does**: Prevents Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks by controlling what resources can load on your website.

**Before**: No CSP → Attackers could inject malicious scripts
**After**: Strict CSP implemented → Only trusted sources allowed

**Configuration**:
```
default-src 'self' → Only load resources from your own domain
script-src → Scripts only from your domain, Google, and Firebase
style-src → Styles only from your domain and Google Fonts
img-src → Images from your domain and HTTPS sources
connect-src → API connections only to Firebase and Google
frame-src 'none' → No iframes allowed
object-src 'none' → No plugins allowed
```

**Real-world protection**: Prevents hackers from injecting malicious JavaScript to steal user data.

---

### 2. **X-Frame-Options: DENY** 🚫
**What it does**: Prevents your website from being loaded inside an iframe.

**Before**: No protection → Attackers could embed your site in a fake login page
**After**: DENY → Your site cannot be framed at all

**Real-world protection**: Prevents clickjacking attacks where attackers trick users into clicking hidden buttons.

**Example Attack Prevented**:
```
Attacker creates fake bank website
    ↓
Embeds real bank login in invisible iframe
    ↓
User thinks they're clicking "Accept Terms"
    ↓
Actually clicking "Transfer Money" on hidden bank page
    ❌ BLOCKED by X-Frame-Options
```

---

### 3. **X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff** 🎭
**What it does**: Prevents browsers from guessing file types.

**Before**: Browser could treat image as JavaScript
**After**: Browser respects declared file type only

**Real-world protection**: Prevents MIME type confusion attacks.

**Example Attack Prevented**:
```
Attacker uploads "image.jpg" (actually JavaScript)
    ↓
Browser tries to execute it as script
    ❌ BLOCKED by nosniff
```

---

### 4. **Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin** 🔗
**What it does**: Controls what information is sent when users click links to other sites.

**Before**: Full URL sent to all websites
**After**: 
- Same site: Full URL shared
- Other HTTPS sites: Only domain shared
- HTTP sites: Nothing shared

**Real-world protection**: Prevents sensitive information leakage through URLs.

**Example**:
```
User on: https://cropify.com/dashboard?userId=12345&token=abc
Clicks external link
    ↓
Without policy: External site sees full URL (leaked token!)
With policy: External site only sees https://cropify.com ✅
```

---

### 5. **Permissions-Policy** 🎛️
**What it does**: Controls which browser features can be used.

**Before**: All features accessible
**After**: Restricted access to:
```
❌ Camera
❌ Microphone  
❌ Geolocation
❌ Payment API
❌ USB devices
❌ Sensors
❌ Autoplay
✅ Fullscreen (only for your site)
```

**Real-world protection**: Prevents malicious scripts from accessing device hardware.

---

### 6. **Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy (COEP)** 🌐
**What it does**: Requires all external resources to explicitly grant permission.

**Configuration**: `unsafe-none` (allows necessary Firebase resources)

**Real-world protection**: Prevents certain side-channel timing attacks.

---

### 7. **Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy (COOP)** 🔐
**What it does**: Isolates your website from other windows/tabs.

**Configuration**: `same-origin`

**Real-world protection**: Prevents cross-window attacks.

**Example Attack Prevented**:
```
Malicious site opens Cropify in new window
    ↓
Tries to access window.opener to steal data
    ❌ BLOCKED by COOP
```

---

### 8. **Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy (CORP)** 📦
**What it does**: Controls who can load your resources.

**Configuration**: `cross-origin` (allows necessary Firebase resources)

**Real-world protection**: Prevents unauthorized embedding of your content.

---

### 9. **Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)** 🔒
**What it does**: Forces browsers to always use HTTPS.

**Configuration**: 
```
max-age=31536000 → Enforced for 1 year
includeSubDomains → Applies to all subdomains
preload → Can be added to browser's preload list
```

**Real-world protection**: Prevents man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Example Attack Prevented**:
```
User types: cropify.com (http)
    ↓
Attacker intercepts on public WiFi
    ↓
HSTS forces: https://cropify.com
    ✅ Encrypted connection, attack failed
```

---

### 10. **Cache-Control** ⏱️
**What it does**: Controls how browsers cache your content.

**Configuration**: `public, max-age=300, must-revalidate`

**Benefits**:
- Faster page loads (5-minute cache)
- Always fresh content (must revalidate)
- Security updates applied quickly

---

### 11. **Server Header** 🏷️
**What it does**: Hides server software details.

**Before**: Exposes server type and version
**After**: Shows "Cropify" only

**Real-world protection**: Prevents attackers from knowing what vulnerabilities to exploit.

---

## 🔐 Application-Level Security

### Multi-Layer Authentication
Beyond web headers, Cropify implements comprehensive authentication:

#### 1. **Firebase Authentication**
- Email/password authentication
- Secure session management
- Automatic token refresh

#### 2. **Admin Verification**
- User must exist in `admins` Firestore collection
- Role-based access control (admin/superadmin)
- Cannot bypass by URL manipulation

#### 3. **Route Protection**
```
User tries to access /dashboard
    ↓
Check: Is user signed in with Firebase? ✓
    ↓
Check: Does user exist in admins collection? ✓
    ↓
Check: Does user have admin role? ✓
    ↓
Check: Is session valid? ✓
    ↓
Grant access ✅
```

#### 4. **Session Management**
- 30-minute inactivity timeout
- Activity monitoring (mouse, keyboard, scroll)
- 5-minute warning before timeout
- Automatic secure cleanup on logout

#### 5. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**
- Optional 2FA for admin accounts
- QR code-based authentication
- Time-based one-time passwords (TOTP)
