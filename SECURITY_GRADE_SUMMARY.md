## 🛡️ 11 Security Headers Implemented

### Critical Protection (High Impact)

1. **Content-Security-Policy (CSP)** 🔒
   - **Protects Against**: XSS attacks (hackers injecting malicious code)
   - **How**: Only allows scripts from trusted sources (Google, Firebase, your domain)
   - **Example**: Blocks `<script>alert('hacked!')</script>` from unknown sources

2. **X-Frame-Options: DENY** 🚫
   - **Protects Against**: Clickjacking (fake login pages)
   - **How**: Prevents your site from being loaded in iframes
   - **Example**: Attackers can't embed your login page in their fake website

3. **Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)** 🔐
   - **Protects Against**: Man-in-the-middle attacks
   - **How**: Forces HTTPS for 1 year, even if user types http://
   - **Example**: Blocks WiFi hackers from intercepting data

4. **Permissions-Policy** 🎛️
   - **Protects Against**: Unauthorized hardware access
   - **How**: Blocks camera, microphone, geolocation, etc.
   - **Example**: Malicious scripts can't secretly access your camera

### Important Protection (Medium Impact)

5. **X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff** 🎭
   - **Protects Against**: MIME confusion attacks
   - **How**: Browser respects file type declarations
   - **Example**: Image files can't be executed as JavaScript

6. **Referrer-Policy** 🔗
   - **Protects Against**: Information leakage
   - **How**: Controls what URLs are shared with external sites
   - **Example**: Sensitive tokens in URLs stay private

7. **Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy (COOP)** 🌐
   - **Protects Against**: Cross-window attacks
   - **How**: Isolates your site from other tabs/windows
   - **Example**: Malicious sites can't access your app's data

8. **Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy (COEP)** 📦
   - **Protects Against**: Side-channel timing attacks
   - **How**: Requires external resources to grant permission
   - **Example**: Enhanced isolation for sensitive operations

9. **Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy (CORP)** 🔓
   - **Protects Against**: Unauthorized resource embedding
   - **How**: Controls who can load your content
   - **Example**: Other sites can't steal your images/files

### Additional Protection (Low Impact)

10. **Cache-Control** ⏱️
    - **Purpose**: Balance speed and freshness
    - **Configuration**: 5-minute cache, must revalidate
    - **Benefit**: Fast page loads + quick security updates

11. **Server Header** 🏷️
    - **Purpose**: Hide server details
    - **Before**: Exposes "nginx 1.18.0" (attack target)
    - **After**: Shows "Cropify" only

## 🔐 Multi-Layer Authentication

Beyond headers, Cropify has 4 layers of authentication:

```
Layer 1: Firebase Authentication ✓
         └─> User must be signed in

Layer 2: Admin Collection Verification ✓
         └─> User must exist in admins database

Layer 3: Role-Based Access Control ✓
         └─> User must have admin/superadmin role

Layer 4: Session Management ✓
         └─> 30-minute timeout, activity monitoring
```

**Result**: **IMPOSSIBLE** to bypass login screen 🔒
